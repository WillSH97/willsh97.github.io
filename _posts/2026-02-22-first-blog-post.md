Hello! First blog post here. Not sure what else will go here - I have just seen a bunch of tech people do this. Not sure if it's out of an inflated sense of self-importance or to flex how smart they are (usually they have some pretty smart stuff to say) or something else, but I figured I may as well give myself an outlet for stuff. There's absolutely no way I'll be as smart as them or in any way interesting, but just let me be a sheep for a second ok?
