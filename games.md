I have been trying to force myself to learn how to make video games for ages - proclaiming this publicly will hopefully have the same effect as telling everyone you’re going to run a marathon and make me commit. Don’t expect anything good and/or interesting here for quite some time though - consider this a “big things coming” notice.
