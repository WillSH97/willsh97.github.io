# <center>FILM</center>

I have been making silly videos since I was like 10 - one of my first successes as a filmmaker was getting 100k views on a Naruto AMV back in 2008. It has a 50% like/dislike ratio because I got copyright struck and the replacement music doesn’t match up to the video. I’ve since learned to appreciate the value of Intellectual Property Law.
